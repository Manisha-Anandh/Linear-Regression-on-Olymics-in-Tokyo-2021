Title: Linear Regression on Tokyo Olympics 2021 Dataset

Description:

This repository contains Python code for performing linear regression to predict total medals won by countries in the Tokyo Olympics 2021 dataset. The code addresses various data handling and model building steps, providing a clear and well-structured implementation.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:
Loads the dataset from an XLSX file using openpyxl.
Handles missing values using SimpleImputer with the 'mean' strategy.
Encodes categorical features (Team/NOC) using OneHotEncoder for compatibility with linear regression.
Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Linear Regression Model:
Creates a linear regression model using LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
Trains the model on the training data.
Evaluates the model's performance (metrics can be added in the future, such as R-squared).
Evaluation and Visualization:
Predicts total medals on the testing set.
Visualizes the relationship between individual medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and total medals using scatter plots with corresponding regression lines.
Compares actual vs predicted total medals for test samples using bar charts.
Installation:

To run this code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
openpyxl
scikit-learn (sklearn)
matplotlib
You can install them using pip:

Bash
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl scikit-learn matplotlib
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Download the Dataset:
Replace the path in dataset = openpyxl.load_workbook(r"C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Medals.xlsx") with the actual path to your downloaded XLSX file containing the Tokyo Olympics 2021 data.
Run the Script:
Execute the Python script (e.g., main.py) to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
Additional Notes:

Consider expanding the model evaluation section by calculating metrics like R-squared or mean squared error to measure the model's performance.
Explore other feature engineering techniques (e.g., scaling features) to potentially improve the model's accuracy.
If the dataset contains more features, you might need to adjust the number of features encoded by the OneHotEncoder.
This code serves as a starting point for exploring linear regression on Olympic data. You can customize it further to fit your specific needs and analyses.
